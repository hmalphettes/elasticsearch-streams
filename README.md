# Elasticsearch streams

Expose a Writeable stream for bulk commands and a Readable stream from
hits and documents responses.

Use case: pipe to and from levelup, pouchdb and other friends.

The client that executes the requests is wrapped in a closure.
It is expected to provide the Elasticsearch reponse's body as a JSON.

See the examples and tests with the official Elasticsearch-js client.

# Installation

```shell
npm install --save elasticsearch-streams
```

# Examples:

## Stream random records into Elasticsearch
```js
var WritableBulk = require('elasticsearch-streams').WritableBulk;
var TransformToBulk = require('elasticsearch-streams').TransformToBulk;
var client = new require('elasticsearch').Client();

var bulkExec = function(bulkCmds, callback) {
  return client.bulk({
    _index : 'myindex',
    _type  : 'mytype',
    body  : bulkCmds
  }, callback);
};
var ws = new WritableBulk(bulkExec);
var toBulk = new TransformToBulk(function getIndexTypeId(doc) { return { _id: doc.id }; });
// stream 42 random records into ES
require('random-document-stream')(42).pipe(toBulk).pipe(ws).on('finish', done);
```

NOTE: One must listen to the `close` event emitted by the write stream to know
when all the data has been written and flushed to Elasticsearch.

Listening to `finish` does not mean much really as we are in this situation:
https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5315#issuecomment-16670354

For example to close the ES client as soon as we are done:

```js
ws.on('close', function () {
  client.close();
});
```

## Stream search results from Elasticsearch
```js
var ReadableSearch = require('elasticsearch-streams').ReadableSearch;
var client = new require('elasticsearch').Client();

var searchExec = function searchExec(from, callback) {
  return client.search({
    index: 'myindex',
    from: from,
    size: 12,
    body: {
      query: { match_all: {} }
    }
  }, callback);
};

var rs = new ReadableSearch(searchExec);
var ws = new require('stream').Writable({objectMode:true});
ws._write = function(chunk, enc, next) {
  console.log('a chunk', chunk);
  next();
};

rs.pipe(ws).on('close', done);
```

If we want to start the stream at an offset and define a limit:

```js
var offset = 7;
var limit  = 21;
var page   = 12;

var searchExec = function searchExec(from, callback) {
  return client.search({
    index: 'myindex',
    from: from + offset,
    size: (offset + from + page) > limit ? (limit - offset - from) : page,
    body: {
      query: { match_all: {} }
    }
  }, callback);
};
```

## Stream scroll/scan results from Elasticsearch
```js
var scrollExec = function scrollExec(from, callback) {
  if (this.scroll_id) {
    return client.scroll({
      scrollId : this.scroll_id,
      scroll   : '30s'
    }, callback);
  }
  // get a scroll id first
  var self = this;
  client.search({
    index: 'myindex',
    scroll: '20s',
    size: 42,
    body: {
      query: { match_all: {} }
    }
  }, function(e, resp) {
    self.scroll_id = resp._scroll_id;
    callback(e, resp);
  });
};
rs = new ReadableSearch(scrollExec);
```

## Stream IDs into Elasticsearch multi-get and get documents out.
```js
var mgetExec = function(docs, callback) {
  return client.mget({
    index: 'myindex',
    type: 'mytype',
    body: {
      docs: { ids: docs }
    }
  }, callback);
};
ts = new PipableDocs(mgetExec, 4);

// Naive read stream of 12 ids that are numbers
var rs = new require('stream').Readable({objectMode: true});
rs._read = function() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
    rs.push(i);
  }
  rs.push(null);
};

var ws = new require('stream').Writable({objectMode:true});
ws._write = function(chunk, enc, next) {
  console.log(hit._id + ' found: ' + hit._found, hit);
  next();
};

rs.pipe(ts).pipe(ws).on('finish', onFinish);
```
